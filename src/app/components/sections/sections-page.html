                                As much as our skills are improving, I see us continuously growing closer together as a team, which is crucial for a group that wants to play at a high level.
                                A couple notes:
                                Guys are asking me how they can get better. Love that - I’ll always give you feedback if you take the time to show up. Know this though, my feedback is blunt, to the point, actionable things that, if executed, would allow you to be the player you want to be. I appreciate Rhyan Miller for taking tough feedback today. Know that if you ask, you’re getting truth from me.
                                Second thing: leadership is going to start forming lines for T2F. Starting O line will play a lot. Starting D Line will play a lot. Subs will be exactly that, subs that come in when needed. You all know that a tournament in Tx heat is grueling and it’s a lot about survival. Subs will get to play a ton, but in the words of coach Hermann Boone “the best players will play”. We’re here to bring home wins for the team - play your role in that to the hilt, and earn your starting spot in practice.
